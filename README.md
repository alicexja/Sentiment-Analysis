# Sentiment-Analysis

<p>
Crowdfunding has been a popular way for many, from people to big companies, to fund risky, uncertain, or otherwise obscure projects. The risk in a crowdfunded project comes from the inability of the project controllers to deliver what they promise; and given the huge rise in low quality “projects” requesting funding, the ability of the platforms being able to detect when things start to go awry is becoming a necessity.

<p>
In this project, I was given a dataset of comments arising from two well-known crowdfunding platforms (Kickstarter and IndieGoGo), along with the sentiment of the comment. These comments have been tagged by real people, so there is also a confidence score associated to it. The variables are:
</p>

<p>
• ID: Comment ID (not predictive)</l>
• Text: Comment in text format. Scraped from the web.
• Sentiment: Either positive (1) or negative (0).
• Confidence: How confident was the scorer on the sentiment score.
</p>

<p>
Starting from this sample,the task is to create a model that infers the sentiment from the text comments and design the way the company will put it into production
